An additional tool for the \ape~suite is presented to detect whether visual cues of deployed artifacts are visible on a Windows user's desktop. The task is done by image recognition in a screenshot using OpenCV, consisting of feature detection, feature matching and outlier rejection with the goal to find a transformation matrix between the features of the observed screenshot and reference images. The implemented tool is then evaluated with respect to quality of the matches and resource consumption, proving the successful implementation with about $90\%$ successful matches within reasonable time and resources for the targeted execution environment.
